## System Overview

### Core Analytical Dimensions

| Dimension | Definition | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| `alignment_score` | Weighted confluence between Supertrend, EMA, and Keltner Channel alignment | Measures synchronization between structural and dynamic trend filters |
| `matrix_code` | Encoded positional classification combining EMA vs. higher-timeframe zones and Keltner Channel positioning | Provides unique situational fingerprint for every bar |
| `scenario_strength` | Context-sensitive sentiment score (-10 to +10) derived from matrix_code and KC trend alignment | Represents qualitative strength of current setup |
| `bullish_score` | Aggregated metric of price, EMA, and KC relationships (0-100) | Quantifies immediate bullish strength for direction validation |
| `atr_percentile` | Percentile rank of smoothed ATR vs. recent history | Gauges volatility regime and potential breakout environment |
| `totalscore` | Normalized confluence score across all analytical layers (0-100) | Final probabilistic indicator for trade decision-making |

### Core Indicators & Parameters
- **EMA 9**: Short-term trend direction
- **EMA 26**: Primary trend filter and structural anchor
- **EMA 252**: Long-term trend (yearly context)
- **Keltner Channel (63 period)**: Volatility-based envelope with trend state
- **SuperTrend (ATR 63, multiplier 3.0)**: Dynamic support/resistance
- **ATR TEMA**: Triple exponential moving average of ATR for smoothed volatility
- **P2D Levels**: Previous 2-day high/low/close reference for structural context

### Scoring Components & Weighting

| Component | Range | Weight | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|--------|---------|
| Alignment | -10 to +10 | 20% | Structural position quality and multi-system confluence |
| Trend | -10 to +10 | 20% | Multi-timeframe directional bias across EMA and KC frameworks |
| Momentum | -10 to +10 | 20% | Price velocity vs. EMA/ST anchors and distance metrics |
| Structure | -7.5 to +7.5 | 15% | Positional geometry, width ratios, and range health |
| Vol/Volume | 0 to +6 | 12% | Volatility expansion and volume participation confirmation |
| Long-term | -6.5 to +6.5 | 13% | Context with EMA 252 (macro bias alignment) |

**Raw Score Range**: -44 to +50  
**Normalized Score Range**: 0 to 100  
**Normalization Formula**: `totalscore = clamp(0, 100, (total_raw + 44) * 100 / 94)`

## Score Interpretation Guide

### Component Score Analysis

#### 1. Alignment Score (-10 to +10)
**Measures**: Structural synchronization across EMA, SuperTrend, and Keltner Channel frameworks

**Interpretation**:
- **+8 to +10**: Optimal bullish structure (Above P2D & Above/Upper KC)
- **+5 to +7**: Good bullish setup (Inside P2D & Above KC)
- **+1 to +4**: Weak bullish bias, requires confirmation
- **-4 to 0**: Weak bearish bias, monitor for deterioration
- **-5 to -7**: Good bearish setup (Inside P2D & Below KC)
- **-8 to -10**: Optimal bearish structure (Below P2D & Below KC)

**Trading Implication**: Primary filter for structural quality

#### 2. Trend Score (-10 to +10)
**Measures**: Multi-timeframe directional bias across EMA and KC frameworks

**Interpretation**:
- **+8 to +10**: Strong bullish alignment across all timeframes
- **+5 to +7**: Moderate bullish trend with some timeframe alignment
- **-5 to -7**: Moderate bearish trend with timeframe confirmation
- **-8 to -10**: Strong bearish alignment across timeframes

**Trading Implication**: Trade only in direction of trend score sign

#### 3. Momentum Score (-10 to +10)
**Measures**: Price velocity and distance from key dynamic levels

**Interpretation**:
- **> +5**: Overextended long (consider profit taking)
- **+2 to +5**: Healthy bullish momentum (ideal for entries)
- **-2 to +2**: Neutral momentum (wait for confirmation)
- **-5 to -2**: Healthy bearish momentum (ideal for short entries)
- **< -5**: Overextended short (consider covering)

**Trading Implication**: Identifies optimal entry timing within trend

#### 4. Structure Score (-7.5 to +7.5)
**Measures**: Positional geometry, range compression/expansion, and breakout status

**Key Metrics**:
- **Width Ratio > 1.5**: Compression releasing (favorable for breakouts)
- **Width Ratio < 0.8**: Consolidation tightening (wait for expansion)
- **EMA26 Position**: Above/Below/Inside P2D range

**Trading Implication**: Gauges potential for explosive moves

#### 5. Volatility/Volume Score (0 to +6)
**Measures**: Volatility expansion and volume participation confirmation

**Interpretation**:
- **5-6**: Maximum conviction (volatility expanding, volume confirming)
- **3-4**: Good confirmation for trade execution
- **0-2**: Weak confirmation (exercise caution)

**Trading Implication**: Requires minimum 3 points for HP entries, 2 points for MP entries

#### 6. Long-term Score (-6.5 to +6.5)
**Measures**: Alignment with primary yearly trend (EMA 252)

**Interpretation**:
- **> +5**: Far above yearly trend (caution: mean reversion risk)
- **+2 to +5**: Healthy uptrend alignment
- **-2 to +2**: Around yearly average (neutral context)
- **-5 to -2**: Healthy downtrend alignment
- **< -5**: Far below yearly trend (potential oversold)

**Trading Implication**: Provides macro context for position bias

### Matrix-Based Trading Rules

**LONG-ONLY Matrix Codes**: 7, 9, 10, 11
- Require `totalscore ≥ 70` for entries
- Codes 10 & 11 represent highest probability bullish structures

**SHORT-ONLY Matrix Codes**: 0, 1, 4, 5
- Require `totalscore ≤ 30` for entries
- Codes 0 & 1 represent highest probability bearish structures

**AVOID/NEUTRAL Codes**: 2, 3, 6, 8
- Mixed structural signals
- Wait for clarity or transition to definitive codes

### Scenario Strength Adjustments

**Alignment Bonus (+2)**:
- Applied when `matrix_code ≥ 8` AND `kc_bullish = true`
- Applied when `matrix_code ≤ 3` AND `kc_bullish = false`

**Misalignment Penalty (-2)**:
- Applied when `matrix_code ≥ 8` AND `kc_bullish = false`
- Applied when `matrix_code ≤ 3` AND `kc_bullish = true`
